"The Ultimate Time Sink (in the Best Way Possible)

I don’t usually leave reviews unless I’ve racked up 20+ hours on Steam—but with over 100 hours on PlayStation, I’m making an exception for Stardew Valley.

This game is pure magic. It’s got that dangerous “just one more day” energy that suddenly has you looking at the clock and realising it’s 3am and you’re up for work in four hours. Whether you’re farming, foraging, fishing, diving into the mines, or making questionable life choices with your in-game friends, there’s always something to do—and always a reason to stay.

Most of my time has been spent playing with my girlfriend, and honestly, it’s been one of the best parts. We’ve laughed, bickered, and strategised our way through countless in-game days, and I really value how it’s given us time to connect (and argue over crop placements).

Highly recommend to anyone—but especially if you’ve got a partner who enjoys games. It’s wholesome, rewarding, and endlessly charming.",2025-06-02 16:45:50,True,english,False,False,76561198032625919,POSITIVE,0.9994248151779175

"""Just one more day..."" this game can be as chill or as goal-oriented (and low-stakes stressful) as you want. There are quests and such, but it's not often that there are consequences for not completing them on time, even if you have a deadline. All of the quests come around again. I recommend using the wiki for anything that stumps you, or that you're curious about. 
Days are around a half-hour each, depending how often you pause. The only downside of this game is that it's easy to think, ""Just one more (Stardew Valley) day, I just want to make sure I..."" over and over, until it's three in the morning. 
On multi-player, there's no pausing. It's a lot of fun to decide what everyone wants to do.",2025-06-02 15:45:39,True,english,False,False,76561198202714883,POSITIVE,0.5665518641471863

"The game sure is fun and also has this certain ""grind""-potential, but at some point it gets pretty dull and frustrating to play, especially when you´re forced to focus only on farming (fish,etc.) and growing crops, because you need a certain amount of money to make some progress. You´re not forced to quickly make progress tho, since it´s up to you if you want to continue with the story asap or if you just want to relax and go mining/fishing/farming,etc. Later on though, there´s a variety of things you can do. A lot of easter eggs and other stuff can also be found during exploration. 
Only being able to grow the crops in certain seasons and the difference in time it takes for them to grow is both exciting (looking forward to being able to grow certain crops again) and challenging (since you need to watch out for how much time of the season you have left to grow the crops, otherwise they will wilt).
The design of the game is very cute and the sounds and music also add on to the game´s atmosphere. The characters and the story are also very well written. The option of being able to grow close with the village ppl and also marry them is also smth you can grind on, since it takes some time to actually increase the amount of hearts you have with them. 
There´ are also conditions for some items as to how to obtain them, for example the only way to get the ""prismatic jelly"" is when a specific quest is active).
Since there´s a lot of content, it´s smth you can spend a lot of time on and won´t need to worry abt the game being over/finished too soon. 
Overall, it´s a super relaxing and addicting farm-game and I would def recommend this!!! 😼",2025-06-02 14:10:11,True,english,False,False,76561198906029129,POSITIVE,0.9918920993804932

"I first bought this game on mobile, on which i have over 300 hours on. I then bought it for switch last year. have over 200 hours on and have achieved perfection on that save. After beating the game i decided to buy it for a third and final time on pc so i could play with mods.
so you can take my word for it when i say that stardew valley is an extremely engaging cozy game with many different aspects for a range of gamers. The story line is engaging while still allowing the game to be very self guided. You are given goals to work towards but the game never forces you to go in one specific direction. There is no wrong way to play stardew valley (except choosing the joja route).

"When I was 5 years and 6 months old I recall receiving a call from my dads work. 
Daddy dead. Said the ups man. 
I took the news quite hard. As did my mother. Mostly because we received it from a Ksenat twitch stream in Traditional chinese text. 
We were heart broken. But my mother far more then I. After several years as a child soldier I discovered my father had not passed away, But in reality gone to a different country and had built a different life. He had recieved a sex change operation and was now known as Natasha. I knew then my true gole, mission in life. To confront my father and asked him why he had faked his death. Years upon years of trecherous battles and horrid living conditions left me with a dazzling six pack. 
Now after turning 7 years old I could finnaly gather up the funds nessesary to travel to Uzbekistan and kill the jhon lenin. 
And also cofront my father. I bid farewell to my mother, Who all waved me off with 7 different coloured handkerchifes. 
Once I arrived to Uzbekistan I started my search. 
After killing jhon lenon Which only took me 5 minutes I started my search for my father.
I found him at an abaandoned condom factory. She/He was knitting condoms from skartch to use for his evil ass deeds. 
I aproached him. They jumped from fear and to my horror I realised my father was my mother all along. and my mother back home had come out as a lesbian. I forgot what I was talking about anyway uh the game right uuh 
This one time I took 60 benadryl and some Austrian guy fisted my asshole without any lubrication aside from his sp[it.

"Stardew Valley is hands down one of my all-time favorite games. the cozy music / the pixel art / the seasonal events... absolutely BEAUTIFUL! I enjoyed every single part of it from farming to mining. The valley feels so alive, and each villager has their own story and secrets.. At first it was kinda overwhelming trying to figure out where everyone was and what they liked/loved to not make mistakes (thanks to the stardew wiki) but I got used to it pretty quick and ended up maxing out hearts with everybody (I was determined to reach perfection) It’s a game that’s easy to get lost in (addictive actually) and always feels comforting no matter how many times I play

"My gf put me up to this game and at first I didn't like it, I've never played a farming sim before and I am more of a FPS, fighting game action game type guy.

It took me whole weeks to get the hang of what I should do and how to manage my time, and funnily enough it has translated to my real life. I can now focus on what I have to do without dragging it on too much and worry about what comes next when the time comes in a timely yet, meaningful manner.

I swear it is underrated in the aspect of what you get out of this game, which is a better sense of meaning to how you spend your time.

"Stardew Valley is by far my favorite co-op multiplayer game. The game is relatively cheap and offers a ton of content, variety, and character depth. There have also been quite a few updates over the years that the game has been out. The game never gets boring. You can either explore the depths of the caves and mines, grind some tasks or give your farm a new lease of life. There are also lots of characters in the game that you can befriend, all of whom are unique. You can marry 12 of them as far as i know (I recommend Abigail♡). The animal selection is also really good. From cats to dogs, from chickens to ostriches, you have a wide selection. And they're all really cute, too. You can also earn money in various ways which you can use to improve tools. Whether through self-made products from animals, fruit, or vegetables, there are many ways to finance your farm.

I have over 400 hours of play time on this game between multiple platforms and I still get enjoyment from playing it. This game has TONS to love for just about any type of gamer and its absolutely the gold standard of not only an indie game but also the entire gaming industry.

This is a game one simply cannot overlook, the top 0.001% of all time best games. Everyone from very casual gamers to more hardcore challenge seeking gamers can find things to love in this game. The autonomy and ability to play this game any way you want makes it outstanding. You can focus on the main quests or side quests, or get lost in farming or fishing or mining or decorating your house. The multiplayer support is as good as it gets with up to 4 player local split screen and also easy to setup online multiplayer, it's very easy to play this with friends or family.",2025-06-01 18:56:58,True,english,False,False,76561198043102407,POSITIVE,0.9996957778930664

"Escaped Capitalism, Married a Loner, Fought Slimes in a Sewer. A Perfect Day.

Stardew Valley is the wholesome mental health retreat you didn’t know you needed... until you found yourself yelling, “I FORGOT TO WATER MY BEANS!!” at 2am.

You inherit a crusty farm from your grandpa, ditch your dead-end job, and move to a town where everyone either wants to date you, fight you, or gift you mayonnaise. Sometimes all three.

You can farm, mine, fish, forage, and raise animals. Or you can do what I did: spend 14 in-game days trying to marry Sebastian while hoarding quartz like a goblin.

The game has it all:
- Slice-of-life romance
- Capitalist-free economy
- Mysterious dwarves
- A wizard in a tower casually watching your life

Also, there's combat. Because nothing says ""relaxing farm life"" like descending into monster-filled caves for rare minerals while avoiding your own emotional baggage.

11/10 would grow parsnips and emotional attachments again.
I’m not crying—you’re crying. In pixel-art.",2025-05-31 06:24:10,True,english,False,False,76561198079616309,NEGATIVE,0.8847783207893372

"I like Stardew Valley, but I don't think this game deserves the ""overwhelmingly positive"" score on steam. I really wish steam had a proper rating system because at first booting up this game it feels new and exciting and really amazing, but I have done a few farms now in the past decade and eventually Stardew Valley gets boring and cumbersome, at least to me personally. I think many reviewers just play for a few hours and recommend it and move to something else, they are misleading others into thinking Stardew valley is some revolutionary game. It is not revolutionary, don't get me wrong, its a solid game, but its easily a 7/10 game for me.

If you want to know the positives of Stardew Valley just read some other reviews, I'm going to give my honest critique. Stardew valley struggles with being a product of its era(2016). In 2016 all games were obsessed with RNG and loot boxs/crates and it was honestly really annoying. It's unfortunate that when I play this game I am constantly reminded of that. There is treasure boxes when fishing, geodes that open with different special minerals and mystery boxes thrown around the map. None of these loot boxes ever give you anything meaningful, there might be the occasional ore that comes up or ""artifact"" that is basically worthless, but after awhile you realize it's meaningless and no longer exciting.

It will take a couple of in-game seasons before you realize it, but this game really struggles with being as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. Fishing becomes repetitive and when you are highly leveled you only have to wait two seconds inbetween casts and you will have already hooked something. Fishing is basically an infinite money generator and honestly it gets boring catching the same fish over and over again.

Relationships in this game are interesting at first, but I'm not playing a farming game to have an E-girlfriend, it just feels silly. Not to mention your character very rarely gives you dialogue options, so 90% of the time it just feels like everyone is talking ""at"" you arbitrarily. Also the hours for all the shops are annoyingly restrictive and many times you walk into a shop and the store owner is just missing despite the store being open. There's also these cool festivals that you can take part in as the player, but most of the festivals are surface level and its just the townspeople wondering around the square with no dialogue options and little to do. This game never can quite get me to believe that the town is ""breathing"" with meaningful relationships. The weird store hours and lack of dialogue options leaves you feeling like an observer or a stranger in town, not a resident. It's definitely not immersive.

Mining in this game is painfully boring, You hit rock after rock and the game rarely rewards you with anything, the enemies in the mines are all boring and uninspired.

All this sounds awful, so why do I give it a 7/10? Well the farming in this game is its biggest redeeming quality. It's very calming and enjoyable clearing out your plots, watering the plants, choosing what to plant and then harvesting. But guess what? During the winter season, the game doesn't let the player do ANY FARMING AT ALL. This means 25% of the time you don't even get to play the best part of the game. Unfortunately to me, it feels like the developer who made this game spent too much time and resources into other gimmicky parts of the game. ""Survival craft"" and ""loot boxes"" were really popular when this game came out, so the developer tacked on this extra garbage into the game for release. At first it seems cool, but it lacks any real depth. All aspects of Stardew Valley are done better in any other game. If I wanted fun mining with monsters, I'd just play Minecraft or Terraria. If I wanted a dating simulator, there's already a million of those to choose from on Steam, I don't need it shoehorned into a farming game. If I wanted a fishing game I would simply play bass pro fishing. I think the developer missed out on creating something truly special by adding way too much random ""era specific"" garbage. If a Stardew Valley 2 ever comes out, I hope most of the resources go into the farming and production aspects of the game, rather than the other random stuff.",2025-05-31 05:25:20,False,english,False,False,76561198150429851,NEGATIVE,0.997815728187561

It's something of the perfect ""de-stress"" game for me after a long, particularly annoying day at work, and every time I boot it up I always enjoy myself.

I was never a big life sim/farming sim guy. Got into this in January 2019 and it changed my life. I've logged hundreds of hours across Switch and now PC, and I'm just going to keep going.

This game is so good that I believe it should be installed on every device as a basic app, like a browser and calculator. The world would become a better place.

"Will thumb up the game, wish there was a middle thumb option lol, spent most of my time on switch version. Got steam deck version to try to play with mods, but the experience was too hellish for me with downloading the mods and working through the Nexus site. It's entirely too cumbersome to get NPC map locations and the expanded version I would of loved to try(both of these especially the former, the dev should consider making official...)


Anyways PC experience aside, the game itself no matter what platform is awesome. A true spiritual successor to harvest moon. It's stunning that to my knowledge, atleast 95+% of the game and music was done by one guy really impresses me.

"""Ah yes, the farming simulator that totally didn't consume every waking hour of my life.""

Stardew Valley is a charming little game where you escape the crushing monotony of corporate life… by voluntarily waking up at 6 AM every day to water plants, chase chickens, and bribe townsfolk with mayonnaise. Freedom at last!

The pixel art is adorable, the music is soothing, and the gameplay is so addictive you’ll forget what daylight looks like. And who needs real friends when you can obsessively court digital ones who only love you after you give them enough fruit? It’s heartwarming. Really.

Of course, the game gives you just enough energy to water half your crops before collapsing in a heap. A beautiful reminder that capitalism is alive and well, even in your virtual utopia.

In all seriousness, Stardew Valley is a masterpiece. It’s equal parts relaxing and compelling, with depth, charm, and just a hint of madness. 10/10 would abandon society and move to Pelican Town again.",2025-05-28 12:02:19,True,english,False,False,76561198073487891,POSITIVE,0.9997616410255432

"I've had this game for many years now and never let a review... as you can see by the amount of hours I raked in it.
First of all, Stardew Valley is a classic of the genre, one that fathered many inspired games with its mechanics... this also mean that while a classic, it's not exactly optimised and some aspects are unpolished. One of the most jarring example are the sprites not matching the portraits.
I do understand it's a game created by a single person! Which is why I appreciate the very active modding community that can help making the gameplay more diverse. Not that the base game is bad, but after you did hundreds of hours it can get a bit old, which is a shame because I do love some aspects of it (namely some characters). 
Pros: Evelyn <3 
Some interesting storylines
Satisfying gameplay, you get to watch your farm go from broke to billionaire from your efforts
Can get weird in a very endearing way
Junimo <3
The duckies can swim in your ponds

other cons: I'm not a fan on how some female characters are written ( especially post marriage)... it can feels oddly shallow at times compared to their male counterparts. Not saying the bachelorettes are bad, but it's not exactly the best game for women romancers. 
Not a huge fan of the implication around Ginger Island
I can't overthrow Lewis and become the mayor.

I mean, this must be one of the most well known and played games because it appeals to such a wide variety of gamer. 
I love this game. I think across the board, this is probably my most played game. I own it on switch, too. I've also purchased countless copies as gifts for friends so that they could experience what a great game it is! You really can't go wrong by getting with this one.

"I absolutely love this game and have played it for years. Every time they do an update I am excited to see all of the new things that are added. If there was one complaint I have it's that I can't achieve ""Perfection"" in single player mode. I got every single star with the exception of the ""Craft Every Item"" Star, and the only crafting recipe I have left is the Wedding Ring, which I read was only obtainable in multiplayer mode. I think there should be an additional way to get that recipe in single player mode. I play single player BECAUSE I just want to play alone with this game. It shouldn't be the only way to get that recipe. But apart from that, it really is such a fun game. It is great to play after a long day, or stressful day, to completely wind down. 

You control where you go and what you do next. There are HOURS of content, and endless opportunities.

"[h3]TL;DR:[/h3]
An incredibly charming farm sim with surprising emotional depth, addictive gameplay loops, and limitless replayability. 

[h3]Overview:[/h3]
[i]Stardew Valley[/i] is a pixel-art farming simulator where you inherit your grandfather's old farm and begin a new life in the sleepy town of Pelican Town. At first glance, it is all crops and cows, but beneath the surface lies a rich world filled with relationships, exploration, seasonal events, dungeon crawling, fishing, foraging, and even romance.

[h3]What I Liked:[/h3]
[b]1. Soothing gameplay:[/b] Planting, harvesting, and upgrading your farm is deeply relaxing.
[b]2. Freedom to choose your path:[/b] Focus on farming, mining, fishing, friendships, whatever you want.
[b]3. Welll-written NPCs:[/b] The townsfolk feel like real people with growth arcs and secrets. Shout out to Sebastian. <3
[b]4. Mod Support:[/b] The modding community is THRIVING. I love playing unmodded and modded. 
[b]5. Multiplayer option:[/b] Cozy co-op farming is incredibly fun. I have only ever played with one other person, but if I had more friends (lol) I could totally see how awesome it would be to play with more people. 

[h3]What I Didn't Like:[/h3]
[b]1. Early game pacing can feel slow:[/b] It takes time to unlock key tools and upgrades.
[b]2. No quest tracking system:[/b] You will sometimes forget who needed what and when.

[h3]Who This Game Is For:[/h3]
If you love open-ended games where you set your own goals, [i]Stardew Valley[/i] is a perfect fit. Great for fans of [i]Animal Crossing[/i], [i]Harvest Moon[/i], or even relaxing puzzle/strategy games. Not ideal if you are seeking fast-paced action or heavily guided progression.

[h3]Tips or Advice:[/h3]
1. Check the weather forecast regularly.
2. Invest in sprinklers ASAP to free up time and energy for other tasks. 
3. Don't sleep on the mines. Combat and ore are key to mid-game progress.

[h3]Final Verdict:[/h3]
